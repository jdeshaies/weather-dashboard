# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a weather dashboard that would display the current and five day forecast of any city searched. This project utilizes the OpenWeather API to get the coordinates of the city searched and the retrieve the weather information and icons. The URL has to be modified three different times to get the coordinates, current weather conditions, and the five day forecast of the city. This project also uses local storage so that when a user searches for a city, it is saved on the side and added as button so that the user can easily click the city and be presented with the weather information again. These will appear even when the user exits the application. For styling, Bootstrap is utilized in everything from the background colors, to the form where a user enters a city, to buttons showing the search history, and so on. This project also uses dayjs to get the current date and format it in MM/DD/YYYY.
